# CS2-Server-Tutorial

This Repo includes an example Casual Server config for a Windows Counter-Strike 2 Dedicated Server!

You can use it on Linux as well but you would need to adjust this config, I just suggest to use following server mangament tool for Linux - https://github.com/1zc/CS2-Pterodactyl

///

This config isn't complete visit this website "Data Dumped" section to adjust Convars and Launch Commands as you like -  https://cs2.poggu.me/
